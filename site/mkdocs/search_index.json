            "text": "Terminology\n\n\nProperty\n\n\nRepresents the top-level branding element of your videos (e.g., TV Network).\n\n\nCollection\n\n\nA sub-category of a Property (e.g., TV Series Name). Within each Collection you also define a Season that represents a subcategory of the collection (i.e. episode #, etc.).  \n\n\nCollection Type\n\n\nA subcategory of a Collection and is used for grouping video content.\n\n\n\n\nIt can include one or more segments (i.e., video upload), a set of related productions, or a single event.\n\n\nDeveloping a good naming convention strategy for a Season is important to ensure a consistent presentation when adding additional seasons.\n\n\nFor example, using Episode, Event, or Part consistently followed for a numbering sequence.\n\n\n\n\nBlind Spot\n\n\nBecause a 360 video is created using multiple cameras, it\u2019s possible your video output could include some clipping of content referred to as a \nNadir Blind Spot\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe blind spot represents the position where the camera rig is supported and the tripod point is either left out of the video or the images are pinched together to eliminate the hole.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe blind spot is usually corrected in post-production and filled in to imply a fully captured 360 image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe blind spot is typically filled by superimposing footage in that area or by inserting a \u201cblack\u201d image at the nadir of the 360 video. The blind spot can then be used to populate with advertising space, navigations, or other uses.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your video includes a blind spot and you adjusted it in post-production by adding a custom photo, logo, or icon to fill the blank space, you can designate the blind spot location (None, Top or Bottom) on the video profile page.\n\n\nVideo Projection\n\n\nRepresents the video projection mapping mode. The Content Console supports Flat and Spherical modes.  \n\n\nFlat Video Projection\n\n\nThis mode supports Monoscopic 360\u00b0 videos.

Copyright \u00a9 2015 Digital Domain Holding Ltd. All Rights Reserved. Do\nnot duplicate or redistribute in any form.\n\n\nContent Policy Guidelines\n\n\nItems posted or through the Digital Domain service must follow our content policy and guidelines, detailed below. Producers or sellers of items are expected to conduct proper research to ensure that the items sold through the Digital Domain service are in compliance with all local, state, national, and international laws. If Digital Domain determines that the content of an item is prohibited, we may summarily remove or alter it without returning any fees the listing has incurred. Digital Domain reserves the right to make judgments about whether or not content is appropriate.\n\n\nPlease take a moment to familiarize yourself with some examples of prohibited content:\n\n\nPornography\n\n\nPornography, X-rated movies, home porn, hard-core material that depict graphic sexual acts, and amateur porn are not permitted. Unrated erotic videos and DVDs of the type you'd find at a typical bookstore are permitted for DVD distribution, but are not permitted Digital Domain distribution. Any permitted nudity, graphic titles, and descriptions must be sufficiently concealed with censor strips on all items containing such content.\n\n\nOffensive Material\n\n\nWhat we deem offensive is probably about what you would expect. This includes items such as crime-scene videos, videos of cruelty to animals, and extremely disturbing materials. Digital Domain reserves the right to determine the appropriateness of items sold on our site. Also, be aware of cultural differences and sensitivities. Some materials may be acceptable in one country, but unacceptable in another. Please keep in mind our global community of customers.\n\n\nIllegal Items\n\n\nItems sold through the Digital Domain service must adhere to all applicable laws. This includes the sale of items by individuals outside the United States. Some items that may not be sold include any products which may lead to the production of an illegal item or illegal activity.\n\n\nStolen Goods\n\n\nIf Digital Domain learns that an item is not the property of the seller, or was obtained through illegal means, we will immediately remove the item from our service.\n\n\n Items that Infringe Upon an Individual's Privacy\n\n\nDigital Domain holds personal privacy in the highest regard. Therefore, items that infringe upon, or have potential to infringe upon, an individual's privacy are prohibited. Additionally, the sale of marketing lists (bulk e-mail lists, direct-mail marketing lists, etc.) is prohibited.\n\n\nRecopied Media\n\n\nCopies, dubs, duplicates, or transfers of music, videos, software, images, etc., are prohibited. Just as you cannot sell a photocopied book without the author's permission, you cannot sell copies or duplicates of videos, music, video games, software, photos, etc. Likewise, you cannot sell transferred media \u2013 whether laserdisc to video, CD-ROM to cassette tape, or from the Internet to any digital format--unless explicitly approved by the author.\n\n\nMovies\n\n\nUnauthorized copies of movies (VHS, DVD, etc.) may not be sold through Digital Domain. Also, movies that have been transferred from one format to another (unless done by the proper rights holder) are not permitted. For example, NTSC to Pal and Pal to NTSC conversions are not permitted unless done by the proper rights holder. Unreleased/prereleased movies, screeners and trailers are prohibited.\n\n\nTelevision Programs\n\n\nUnauthorized copies of television programs, including pay-per-view events, are prohibited. Commercially produced and licensed copies of television programs are permitted. Unauthorized television programs and unauthorized copies of programs never broadcast, unauthorized scripts, unauthorized props, and screeners are prohibited.\n\n\nMusic\n\n\nRecopied music in any format is prohibited. Bootlegs, unauthorized live concerts, unauthorized soundboard recordings, unauthorized merchandise, etc., is not permitted. Content containing unlicensed popular music as its soundtrack is not permitted. Likewise, \"mix\" CDs of unlicensed music are not permitted.\n\n\nPromotional Media\n\n\nMovies, CDs, software, etc., that are produced and distributed for promotional use only are prohibited for sale through Digital Domain.\n\n\nRights of Publicity\n\n\nCelebrity images and/or celebrity names cannot be used for commercial purposes without permission of the celebrity or their management. This includes product endorsements and merchandise as well as unauthorized celebrity image collections.\n\n\nPublic Domain and Other Non-Exclusive Content\n\n\nSome types of content, such as public domain content, may be free to use by anyone, or may be licensed for use by more than one party. We will not accept content that is freely available on the web unless you are the copyright owner of that content. For example, if you received your content from a source that allows you and others to re-distribute it, and the content is freely available on the web, we will not accept it for sale through Digital Domain. We do accept public domain content, however we may request that you provide proof that your submitted material is actually in the public domain and may choose to not sell a public domain title if its content is undifferentiated or barely differentiated from one or more books already available through our service or available through other retail sites. We do not currently accept public domain material for Digital Domain video  service.",

            "text": "Items posted or through the Digital Domain service must follow our content policy and guidelines, detailed below. Producers or sellers of items are expected to conduct proper research to ensure that the items sold through the Digital Domain service are in compliance with all local, state, national, and international laws. If Digital Domain determines that the content of an item is prohibited, we may summarily remove or alter it without returning any fees the listing has incurred. Digital Domain reserves the right to make judgments about whether or not content is appropriate.  Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some examples of prohibited content:  Pornography  Pornography, X-rated movies, home porn, hard-core material that depict graphic sexual acts, and amateur porn are not permitted. Unrated erotic videos and DVDs of the type you'd find at a typical bookstore are permitted for DVD distribution, but are not permitted Digital Domain distribution. Any permitted nudity, graphic titles, and descriptions must be sufficiently concealed with censor strips on all items containing such content.  Offensive Material  What we deem offensive is probably about what you would expect. This includes items such as crime-scene videos, videos of cruelty to animals, and extremely disturbing materials. Digital Domain reserves the right to determine the appropriateness of items sold on our site. Also, be aware of cultural differences and sensitivities. Some materials may be acceptable in one country, but unacceptable in another. Please keep in mind our global community of customers.  Illegal Items  Items sold through the Digital Domain service must adhere to all applicable laws. This includes the sale of items by individuals outside the United States. Some items that may not be sold include any products which may lead to the production of an illegal item or illegal activity.  Stolen Goods  If Digital Domain learns that an item is not the property of the seller, or was obtained through illegal means, we will immediately remove the item from our service.   Items that Infringe Upon an Individual's Privacy  Digital Domain holds personal privacy in the highest regard. Therefore, items that infringe upon, or have potential to infringe upon, an individual's privacy are prohibited. Additionally, the sale of marketing lists (bulk e-mail lists, direct-mail marketing lists, etc.) is prohibited.  Recopied Media  Copies, dubs, duplicates, or transfers of music, videos, software, images, etc., are prohibited. Just as you cannot sell a photocopied book without the author's permission, you cannot sell copies or duplicates of videos, music, video games, software, photos, etc. Likewise, you cannot sell transferred media \u2013 whether laserdisc to video, CD-ROM to cassette tape, or from the Internet to any digital format--unless explicitly approved by the author.  Movies  Unauthorized copies of movies (VHS, DVD, etc.) may not be sold through Digital Domain. Also, movies that have been transferred from one format to another (unless done by the proper rights holder) are not permitted. For example, NTSC to Pal and Pal to NTSC conversions are not permitted unless done by the proper rights holder. Unreleased/prereleased movies, screeners and trailers are prohibited.  Television Programs  Unauthorized copies of television programs, including pay-per-view events, are prohibited. Commercially produced and licensed copies of television programs are permitted. Unauthorized television programs and unauthorized copies of programs never broadcast, unauthorized scripts, unauthorized props, and screeners are prohibited.  Music  Recopied music in any format is prohibited. Bootlegs, unauthorized live concerts, unauthorized soundboard recordings, unauthorized merchandise, etc., is not permitted. Content containing unlicensed popular music as its soundtrack is not permitted. Likewise, \"mix\" CDs of unlicensed music are not permitted.  Promotional Media  Movies, CDs, software, etc., that are produced and distributed for promotional use only are prohibited for sale through Digital Domain.  Rights of Publicity  Celebrity images and/or celebrity names cannot be used for commercial purposes without permission of the celebrity or their management. This includes product endorsements and merchandise as well as unauthorized celebrity image collections.  Public Domain and Other Non-Exclusive Content  Some types of content, such as public domain content, may be free to use by anyone, or may be licensed for use by more than one party. We will not accept content that is freely available on the web unless you are the copyright owner of that content. For example, if you received your content from a source that allows you and others to re-distribute it, and the content is freely available on the web, we will not accept it for sale through Digital Domain. We do accept public domain content, however we may request that you provide proof that your submitted material is actually in the public domain and may choose to not sell a public domain title if its content is undifferentiated or barely differentiated from one or more books already available through our service or available through other retail sites. We do not currently accept public domain material for Digital Domain video  service.",
