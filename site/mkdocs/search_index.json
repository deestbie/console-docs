Create Media Assets\n\n\nPrepare the following media assets and have them available prior to creating a media (video, external URL, or live event) or application profile in the Content Console. Because you will be required to upload a video, external URL, or post a live stream URL for a live event before you can save your video profile, having these assets available will help to expedite the video publishing process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptions\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n360 Video Files\n\n\nShoot 360 videos, perform post production, and generate output files. Determine if videos will be uploaded directly to the Digital Domain CMS, or whether they will be hosted on a Content Delivery Network or Media Server). In this scenario, you will need to have the external URL's of each video available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLive Event\n\n\nDetermine number of live streams you will have per event (i.e., main stream, multiple camera angles, etc.), and where they will be hosted (i.e., Content Delivery Network, Media Server, or Direct from 360 video camera).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Metadata\n\n\nDefine video Title, Headline, Description, and Search Tags for each video language version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Art\n\n\nDefine thumbnails for each video that will stored in the Content Management System (i.e. Content Console).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Based on your distribution strategy, you may need to publish multiple video formats for the same video profile. These media assets should also be prepared as part of this prerequisite step.\n\n\nStep 2. Determine Digital Asset Storage and Management Approach\n\n\nThe digital asset management process involves storage of assets and managing them for presentation on websites or mobile device applications. Organizations with large projects typically use a combination of Content Delivery Network (CDN) services for storing digital assets and Content Management Systems (CMS) associated with each unique product.  \n\n\nBased on your requirements select an external service to for managing your assets or use our hosted video solution:\n\n\nStreaming Media Service / Content Delivery Network (CDN)\n\n\n\n\nSelect a content delivery solution (high-end media server or Content Delivery Network) that can securely store your digital assets.\n\n\nSolution must support serving of content to end-users with high availability and high performance.\n\n\nSolution must provide easy-to-use codec conversion utilities that allow you to convert digital assets to the required format of any supported device.\n\n\nSolution must include a live streaming service.\n\n\n\n\nDigital Domain Hosted Video Solution\n\n\n\n\nUpload videos and live stream directly to our server.\n\n\nIn case of an outage, Content Console digital assets and the associated network infrastructure is stored on multiple offsite disparate locations to ensure continuity of service.\n\n\n\n\nContact our Client Services Specialists to develop a solution that best suits your needs and requirements.\n\n\nStep 3.

Each website or mobile device platform will have requirements for the video format and size they accept to guarantee optimum performance.\n\n\nTo accommodate this requirement, the Content Console allows you to upload multiple formats of the same video for a single video profile. You can then label each video, designate the website or mobile device application (and platform) the video is associated with, and post the format-specific URL to these websites and applications.\n\n\nDuring the initial upload process, you will select the \nmain video content\n as your first upload. You can upload additional video formats in the \nEdit > Video Formats\n section as part of the initial video configuration process or as a post-upload activity. The video you select as your main video content, will display in the video player on the \nVideo Details\n page, and additional formats will display in the \nVideo Formats\n section.\n\n\nThe following tutorial illustrates how to upload a new video format:\n\n\nStep 1: Complete Video Upload Process\n\n\n\n\nComplete the initial upload process (\nHosted Video\n or \nExternal Video\n).

You will:\n\n\n\n\nSpecify stream origin\n\n\nSet the property and collection the live stream will be contained in.\n\n\nDefine live event metadata (i.e., title, description, pre stream / post stream text, and tags).\n\n\nConfigure live event visibility\n\n\nSet live event start time and duration.\n\n\nSpecify additional stream URLs (Return, Share, and Meta)\n\n\nSet live stream projection\n\n\nSet stream blind spot\n\n\nSave live event\n\n\nTest live stream\n\n\nAdd key art\n\n\nEdit live event\n\n\nPublish live event.\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Select Media Upload Method\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can launch the easy-to-use \nMedia Upload\n publishing tool using the following paths:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the Cloud Icon \n conveniently accessible via the Content Console header.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to \nProperty > Collection\n and select \n+Upload Video\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the \nMedia Upload\n page, select the \nLive Event\n option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Specify Stream Origin URL\n\n\nThe first step in the live event setup process is to specify a Stream Origin URL. This URL type represents the publishing point URL where the live stream is originally hosted.\n\n\nNote: You can also specify additional optional Stream URLs (Stream Return, Stream Share, and Stream Meta). In Step 7.\n\n\nYour live stream must meet the following requirements:\n\n\n\n\nSee \nMedia Publishing Requirements\n for prerequisite steps and video and audio requirements.\n\n\nSee \nLive Streams\n for supported HTTP Live Streaming requirements.\n\n\nIf you will be using multiple live stream cameras, the URL published during the initial upload process represents your first stream in the sequence. You will then specify subsequent streams via the \nCamera\n page after the initial upload process is complete.\n\n\nYou can set visibility for the entire \"Live Event\" instance \nonly\n. You cannot set visibility for specific live stream camera entries within live event the instance (i.e., on the \nCameras\n page).\n\n\n\n\nTo specify the stream origin URL:\n\n\n\n\nGo to \nStream Origin URL\n.\n\n\nSpecify the main stream for the live event.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Define Video Metadata\n\n\nMetadata is used to uniquely identify the characteristics of each live event. Data entered here will be visibility for all stream entries (i.e., Stream Origin plus multiple camera entries).\n\n\n\n\nVideos can be tagged with metadata including Title, Description, Pre Stream Text, and Post Stream Text.\n\n\nThe default language for metadata is \nEnglish\n.\n\n\nA Consumer will see the metadata on websites where a video is posted.  \n\n\nA Publisher can search for metadata in the Content Console.\n\n\nYou can add additional language versions on the \nEdit Video\n page after the video upload process is complete.\n\n\nSee \nVideo Metadata\n more information on metadata types.\n\n\n\n\nTo define video metadata:\n\n\n\n\nGo to \nDetails\n.\n\n\nEnter the (Stream) Title, Description, Pre Stream, and Post Stream text for your video.\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Select Property and Collection\n\n\nAssign a property to your live event and group it in a collection. Both steps are required.\n\n\n\n\nGo to \nSettings\n.\n\n\nIn \nAssign to a property\n, select a property from the drop-down to assign to the current live event.\n\n\nAfter you select the property, the \nAssign to a collection\"\n drop-down displays and presents a list of collections associated with the current property. Select a collection to assign to the live event.\n\n\n\n\nStep 5: Configure Video Security\n\n\nThroughout the publishing cycle, your  will require different levels of security for access, downloading, and sharing to social networks.

Verify that your live stream is available and adheres to the HTTP Live Streaming requirements try again.\n\n\n\n\nStep 13: Add Key Art\n\n\nKey Art\n is an still image file that is used to showcase your live event. It typically uses a memorable image or icon that represents the essence of the story or topic presented in a live event. Key art is also referred to as a \nthumbnail\n. When your live event was initially uploaded a thumbnail was assigned as the default start page.\n\n\n\n\nYou can upload a key art to replace auto-generated version.\n\n\nKey Art displays on your live event profile, property, and collection pages.\n\n\n\n\nSupported key art size specifications include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Art Setting\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Size\n\n\n16:9, 1600 x 825\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormat\n\n\n4K\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLive Area\n\n\nSquare, 825 x 825\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo upload key art:\n\n\n\n\nSelect the current image and upload a new image based on the image requirements.\n\n\n\n\nStep 14: Publish Live Event\n\n\n\n\nOn the \nEdit\n page, if you are ready to publish the live event, select \nSave\n.\n\n\nMake sure your live event is set to \"Public\" in  \nVisibility\n before the defined start time.\n\n\nTo add additional cameras to the current live event profile, go to \nAdd Camera\n.",

Here's some background on how the process works:\n\n\n\n\nThe \nmain\n camera always retains a display order of zero (0).\n\n\nTo update the \nmain\n camera, you must change the Origin URL on the live event \nEdit\n page.\n\n\nYou can add additional cameras that represent different views or angles using the \n+ Camera\n option on the live event \nEdit\n page.\n\n\nAdditional cameras can be updated on the \nStream Details > Cameras\n section by selecting the camera display name.\n\n\nYou can change the sequence order of additional cameras.\n\n\nEach additional camera displays as a selectable button on the HTML5 player where your live event is posted (i.e., on a mobile device app, or embedded on a website or social media network).\n\n\nThe \nmain\n camera will always display as the first camera (far left) on the HTML5 player.\n\n\n\n\nTo update a main live event camera:\n\n\n\n\nGo to \nOrganization Name > Property > Collection\n.\n\n\nSelect a live stream (i.e., HLS). The \nStream Details\n page displays.\n\n\nSelect the \nEdit\n tab.\n\n\nChange the \nStatus\n to \nStopped\n.\n\n\nIn the \nCameras\n section, update the \"Origin URL\" and \nSave\n.\n\n\nGo back to the \nEdit\n tab and select \nCheck Stream\n to verify that the updated URL works properly.\n\n\nIf the live stream runs successfully, change the \nStatus\n to \nReady\n.\n\n\nIf your \nmain\n camera is embedded on a website or social media network, go to \nStream Details\n, \nCopy Embed Code\n for this camera and repost to the appropriate locations.\n\n\nIf your \nmain\n camera is on a mobile device app only, the URL is automatically updated after you \nSave\n the live event media profile.\n\n\n\n\nTo update an additional live event camera:\n\n\n\n\nGo to \nOrganization Name > Property > Collection\n.\n\n\nSelect a live event. The \nStream Details\n page displays.\n\n\nIn the \nCameras\n section, select a hyperlinked camera name.\n\n\nPerform updates as needed on Camera Name, Description, Origin URL, Projection, Blindspot, Display Order, and Active.\n\n\nSelect \nUpdate\n to apply changes.\n\n\n\n\nHow do I obtain embed code for live event?\n\n\nThe \nStream Details\n pages include a \nCopy Embed Code\n option that allows you to live event cameras on external websites and social media sites. Example embed code looks similar to the following:\n\n\n\n\nTo copy embed code:\n\n\n\n\nGo to \nOrganization Name > Property > Collection\n.\n\n\nSelect a live event (HLS). The \nStream Details\n page displays.\n\n\nSelect \nCopy Embed Code\n. The Embed Code pop-up displays.\n\n\nSelect and copy the iframe code.\n\n\nIntegrate the code into your website or social media network.\n\n\n\n\nHow do I test my live stream?\n\n\nYou can test the stream for your live event to determine if its running properly using the \nCheck Stream\n option. The function executes a live stream check service and verifies the live stream against the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) document \nHTTPS Live Streaming\ndraft-pantos-http-live-streaming-19\n.\n\n\nThe following list briefly summarizes what happens during the live stream check:\n\n\n\n\nVerify that the live stream playlist exists.\n\n\nVerify that the live stream playlist is valid according to the specification. Each playlist includes \"tags.\" Some tags are required, other tags are required only when tags with specific values are present.\n\n\nThe \nCheck Stream\n service drills down through the HTTP Live Streaming rules to verify if the live stream playlist is valid.\n\n\nIf the live stream is stopped, you will immediately receive a source error message. This indicates that the URL is not accessible. Because the stream content cannot be accessible the stream check ends.\n\n\nIf the live stream is started, but the protocols do not match the HTTP Live Streaming specification, you will also receive a source error message.\n\n\nIf the live stream is started and is successfully verified against the HTTP Live Streaming specification, you will receive a confirmation message that the stream check was successful.  \n\n\n\n\nTo test live event stream:\n\n\n\n\nGo to \nOrganization Name > Property > Collection\n.\n\n\nSelect a video. The \nVideo Details\n page displays.\n\n\nSelect the \nEdit\n tab.\n\n\nSelect \nCheck Stream\n.\n\n\nIf the stream check is successful, you will receive a confirmation message.\n\n\nIf the stream check is not successful, you will receive a source error message. Verify that your live stream is available and adheres to the HTTP Live Streaming requirements try again.\n\n\n\n\nHow do I play a live stream?\n\n\n\n\nGo to \nOrganization Name > Property > Collection\n.\n\n\nSelect a video or live stream. The \nStream Details\n page displays.\n\n\nSelect \nPlay\n.\n\n\nPlay speed is based on your wifi connection and local bandwidth. If the live stream is not available a message \"The requested program is unavailable\" message displays. This means that the live stream event is over (based on the designated start / stop time).\n\n\n\n\nHow do I upload or refresh key art?\n\n\n\n\nGo to \nOrganization Name > Property > Collection\n.\n\n\nSelect a video or live stream. The \nStream Details\n page displays.\n\n\nSelect the \nEdit\n tab.\n\n\nSelect \nUpload Key Art\n.\n\n\nSelect a file to upload based on the image requirements, then \nClose\n.\n\n\nSelect \nSave\n to upload the key art and save it to your live event media profile.\n\n\n\n\nHow do I change the property or collection of a live event media profile?\n\n\n\n\nGo to \nOrganization Name > Property > Collection\n.\n\n\nSelect a video or live stream. The \nStream Details\n page displays.\n\n\nSelect the \nEdit\n tab.\n\n\nFrom the \nProperty\n drop-down, select a new property to assign to the current live event.\n\n\nFrom the \nCollection\n drop-down, select a new property to assign to the current live event.\n\n\nAfter completing your selections, \nSave\n. The live event will be added and regrouped into the new property and/or collection.\n\n\n\n\nHow do I update the visibility settings of a live event media profile?\n\n\nA variety of scenarios may require you to change your visibility settings. For example:\n\n\n\n\nYour live event media profile configuration is complete and you are now ready to go live and publish it (i.e., set to Public).\n\n\nThere is a technical issue with your live event media profile and you want to temporarily take it offline (i.e., set it to Private or Internal).\n\n\nThe established run time of your live event media profile has completed and you want to permanently take it offline (i.e., set it to Private or Internal)\n\n\n\n\nTo update visibility settings:\n\n\n\n\nGo to \nOrganization Name > Property > Collection\n.\n\n\nSelect a video or live stream. The \nStream Details\n page displays.\n\n\nSelect the \nEdit\n tab.\n\n\nIn \nVisibility\n, select Private, Internal, or Public.\n\n\nAfter completing your selections, \nSave\n. The visibility of your live event be updated. Live events that are set to Internal or Private will be removed from any collections exposed in your applications. Embedded URL will present the live event as no longer available.\n\n\n\n\nHow do I add a language to a live event media profile?\n\n\nThe following topics illustrate how to add a language to a live event media profile:\n\n\n\n\nAdd Language - Live Event\n\n\n\n\nHow do I delete a language in a live event media profile?\n\n\nThe following topic illustrate how to delete a language in a live event media profile:\n\n\n\n\nDelete Language\n\n\n\n\nHow do I update metadata for a live event profile?\n\n\n\n\nGo to \nOrganization Name > Property > Collection\n.\n\n\nSelect a live event. The \nStream Details\n page displays.\n\n\nSelect the \nEdit\n tab.\n\n\nUpdate Stream Title, Pre Stream Message, Post Stream Message, Description, and Tags.\n\n\nPerform an update and \nSave\n. The \nStream Details\n page displays and presents your updated content.\n\n\n\n\nHow do I update the status of a live event?\n\n\nEach live event media profile includes a \nStatus\n section that is used to manage the workflow cycle of your live event. The status applies to \nAll\n cameras that are defined in the media profile as a group (i.e., main and additional cameras). The following status states are supported:\n\n\nNote: All Status settings must be set manually in the current Content Console release.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLive Event Status\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStopped\n\n\nWhen you initially create a live event media profile, the default status is \nStopped\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReady\n\n\nAll setup, configuration, and testing work is complete on the live event and it is ready to go live.

            "text": "Technical FAQ (Application)\n\n\nWhat is an App Profile?\n\n\nMobile device apps are developed using mobile device development tools specific to each supported platform. During the design process all of the assets required for a specific app are defined (i.e., images, screen content, etc.), along with image size requirements and format. All of the app assets are considered metadata and will be stored in the Digital Domain Content Console.\n\n\nAfter the application development is complete and the assets have been defined, an application instance is added to the Digital Domain Content Console. Here you catalog the various parts of your app.\n\n\n\n\nThe app is automatically associated with the current Organization.\n\n\nApp Name, Description, Type, Version, and Store URL are informational identifiers that are internal to the Content Console\n\n\nBundle ID (iOS) or Package Name (Android) is a unique identifier for the application asset bundle that includes branding art and stylesheet information.\n\n\nAnalytics ID includes captured statistical data about your app.\n\n\n\n\nWhen a new asset is added to the app, the asset bundle is updated (which is associated with the Bundle ID). The App ID then gets passed to the mobile device API, and an API call is initiated that fetches the newly uploaded asset and updates the live application. Statistical data is updated in a similar manner and report can be viewed at different hierarchies in the Content Console.\n\n\nHow do I add an application instance to the Content Console?\n\n\nSee \nPublish Application\n for detailed instructions on how to add an application instance to the Content Console.\n\n\nHow long does it take to configure an app profile in the Content Console?\n\n\nIf you have all of your application assets available, the configuration process for each application should take approximately ten minutes.\n\n\nHow do I associate an app with a video collection stored on the Content Console?\n\n\nYour Organization Administrator is responsible for associating video collections with application instances. Depending on the nature of the app, the management and visibility of content within a video collection that is available app could be a 24/7 process (for live events), or on a periodic basis if the app presents VoD content only.   \n\n\nIf update a video profile, are changes automatically posted my distribution apps?\n\n\nIf the collection the video you are updating is a designated distribution app, the video content will be automatically updated.\n\n\nDo I have to resubmit my app to its platform-specific store every time I perform an update?\n\n\nThe requirement of resubmitting an app to its platform-specific store is based on the type of update you are performing.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are updating app assets, the updates will occur immediately.\n\n\nIf the update is a more significant feature or bug update it may be necessary to resubmit the app to its store. In this scenario, the update would post to the app installation in the mobile device app store and the user would need to initiate the update process.\n\n\n\n\nHow do I localize an app?\n\n\nApp localization occurs at the native code level, and at the app instance level (in the Content Console).\n\n\n\n\nAt the app development level (i.e., native code), Client Services will provide each client with a localization package that includes metadata that will display in the app (i.e., labels, menu item names, hover text, description text, etc). This metadata will be translated by the client into the designated language. This translated code will then be added to the native app code for the localized app version.\n\n\nAt the Content Console level, if your distribution scenario requires a mobile device app in English, Spanish, and French (for example) you will have three application instances added to the Content Console.\n\n\nEach will have localized assets, a unique bundle ID, application ID, and analytics ID.\n\n\n\n\nAs a client, do I submit my mobile device application to a store, or does Client Services perform that task?\n\n\nThis depends on your onboarding agreement, application type, and specific requirements. To common scenarios include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor native apps\n (i.e., ones that Digital Domain exclusively develops for a client), Client Services handles generating the bundle id or package name, submitting it to the platform-specific store, and adding it to the application instance in the Content Console.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor custom apps\n (depending on the arrangement with Client Services), the client may provide Digital Domain with a Bundle ID or Package Name that Client Services adds to an application instance in the Content Console, and the client may submit the application to the platform-specific store.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre application assets added to the Content Console after the mobile device application is published to a platform-specific store?\n\n\nApplication assets are independent from submission to a platform-specific app stores. An app store doesn't see the assets in the Digital Domain Content Console, only the resulting usage of the assets in the application. Generally the application instance and associated assets are added to the Content Console prior to submission to a platform-specific app store as they are needed for the development and design cycles.\n\n\nIn what scenario would I need to update my Token Secret?\n\n\nThe Token ID / Token Secret is built into the mobile device app so it can talk to the Content Console (i.e., retrieve updated metadata/assets, fetch analytics ID so it can generate analytics reports, etc). If you feel your Content Console login has been compromised, as the client you will need a new Token Secret to successfully authenticate and log into the Content Console. In this scenario, send a request to your Client Services representative for assistance.",

Within each Collection you also define a Season that represents a subcategory of the collection (i.e. episode #, etc.).  \n\n\nCollection Type\n\n\nA subcategory of a Collection and is used for grouping video content.\n\n\n\n\nIt can include one or more segments (i.e., video upload), a set of related productions, or a single event.\n\n\nDeveloping a good naming convention strategy for a Season is important to ensure a consistent presentation when adding additional seasons.\n\n\nFor example, using Episode, Event, or Part consistently followed for a numbering sequence.\n\n\n\n\nVideo Metadata\n\n\nMetadata allows you to describe the content of a video. The following list includes the metadata categories supported by the Content Console and composition guidelines.\n\n\nTitle (Required)\n\n\n\n\nEffective titles summarize the video subject.\n\n\nThey typically contain 5 words are less.\n\n\nUse descriptive keywords that grab a viewers attention.\n\n\nShould make sense out of context when they appear in search research.\n\n\nThere is no character limitation for video titles.\n\n\nThe first 50 characters (including spaces) display in a search list.\n\n\n\n\nHeadline\n\n\n\n\nEffective headlines use a unique a set of reasons why a user should view your video.\n\n\nSome techniques for creating catchy headlines include using numbers, trigger words, adjectives, keywords, and promises (e.g., details on what you will experience when watching the video, etc.).\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nEffective descriptions are concise (e.g., a small paragraph or lead-in sentence with bullet points).\n\n\nShould include exciting descriptions about video topic that will attract viewers attention.\n\n\nShould include hashtags (#) so they can be easily promoted on social media site.\n\n\nShould include credits associated with video creator, participants, actors, promoters, etc.\n\n\n\n\nPre Screen Text\n (for LIVE EVENT ONLY)\n\n\n\n\nRepresents introductory content for your video.\n\n\n\n\nPost Screen Text\n (for LIVE EVENT ONLY)\n\n\n\n\nRepresents text that will display after a video has finished playing (e.g., Thanks for watching, Visit our website, etc.).\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\n\n\n\nSearch tags help to promote your video on social media sites and search engines.\n\n\nShould contain keywords on who you are (individual, business, event, etc.)\n\n\nTo gain an edge on coverage, perform research on competitors, sites most relevant to your video subject, and tag names.\n\n\nSearch tags must be comma separated.\n\n\nTags are committed by selecting Return. The tag will display in blue.\n\n\nYou can delete a tag by selecting \"x\".\n\n\nIf attempt to add a tag name that already exists you will not be able to commit it.\n\n\n\n\nBlind Spot\n\n\nBecause a 360 video is created using multiple cameras, it\u2019s possible your video output could include some clipping of content referred to as a \nNadir Blind Spot\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe blind spot represents the position where the camera rig is supported and the tripod point is either left out of the video or the images are pinched together to eliminate the hole.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe blind spot is usually corrected in post-production and filled in to imply a fully captured 360 image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe blind spot is typically filled by superimposing footage in that area or by inserting a \u201cblack\u201d image at the nadir of the 360 video. The blind spot can then be used to populate with advertising space, navigations, or other uses.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your video includes a blind spot and you adjusted it in post-production by adding a custom photo, logo, or icon to fill the blank space, you can designate the blind spot location (None, Top or Bottom) on the video profile page.\n\n\nVideo Projection\n\n\nRepresents the video projection mapping mode. The Content Console supports \nFlat\n and \nSpherical\n modes.  \n\n\nFlat Video Projection\n\n\nThis mode supports Monoscopic 360\u00b0 videos. This video type is typically filmed with a single camera and stitched together to form a single equirectangular video.\n\n\nSpherical Video Projection\n\n\nThis video type is usually filmed using two or more cameras and supports the use of HMD devices. Characteristics include:\n\n\n\n\nUses stereoscopic technique to render images so there is a slight offset between your left and right eye.\n\n\nThis view creates and impression of depth a full 360 experience.\n\n\n\n\nKey Art\n\n\nA still image file that is used to showcase your video.\n\n\n\n\nIt typically uses a memorable image or icon that represents the essence of the story or topic presented in a video.\n\n\nYou upload key art during the video publishing phase.\n\n\nKey Art displays on your video profile, property, and collection pages.\n\n\nAlso referred to as a \nThumbnail\n.\n\n\n\n\nVideo on Demand (VoD)\n\n\nVoD stands for \nVideo on Demand\n. This video format is saved in a MP4 file (required by the Content Console) and can be accessed any time by the user. VoD files can be directly uploaded to the Content Console, or can by specifying an external URL that represents where the video is stored (e.g., media server, content delivery network, etc.).\n\n\n\n\nThis video format stores data (in a compressed form) that is required to depict a video signal. VoD files supported by the Content Console must be generated from 360 degree cameras.\n\n\nVoD files cannot be read in their initial \"Raw\" format and must be converted to the supported codec for video and audio file formats for mobile devices.\n\n\nWhen convert your VoD files to the required format, you will configure measurements for various categories of the video signal based on the file size you are converting the VoD file to.\n\n\n\n\nSee \nMedia Publishing Requirements\n for more information on VoD conversion requirements for videos you would like to upload to the Content Console.\n\n\nLive Event\n\n\nA Live event is composed of one or more live streams that are hosted on an external streaming Media Server, a Content Delivery Network (CDN), or streamed directly from a 360 camera.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCameras that support live 360 video stitching and streaming can utilize the live event option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can add a live streams from a single 360 video camera or using an array of synchronized cameras (i.e., multiple 360 video cameras).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing your 360 video camera, you can create a customized RTSP request URL stream link for external media players, or let your camera generate a default URL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can add live stream URLs from your Media Server or Content Delivery Network, or you can live stream directly from your 360 camera (depending on internet connectivity).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can add a URL to the Content Console for each additional 360 video camera and specify a camera label that uniquely identifies characteristics of the stream (e.g., angle, associated mobile devices, video format, etc.). See \nAdd Camera\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Formats\n\n\nThe distribution strategy for your video content is based on many factors. For example your video marketing plan may include requirements for:\n\n\n\n\nAchieving brand awareness\n\n\nThe number of user engagements through social sharing you want to achieve\n\n\nThe level of metrics (e.g., views, coverage in geographical region, etc.) you want to achieve\n\n\n\n\nThese goals will in turn require you to define where you want to post your video digital assets (e.g., on websites, mobile device applications, etc.). Each website or mobile device platform will have requirements for the \nvideo format\n and size they accept to guarantee optimum performance.\n\n\nThe \nVideo > Edit\n page includes a \nVideo Formats\n section that allows you to upload multiple formats of the same video for a single video profile. You can then label each video, designate the website or mobile device application (and platform) the video is associated with, and post the format-specific URL to these websites and applications.\n\n\nSee \nMedia Publishing Requirements\n for a list of supported video formats. See go to \nAdd Video Formats\n for instruction on how to add a new video format.\n\n\nHLS (HTTP Live Streaming)\n\n\nHTTP Live Streaming (HLS) is an HTTP-based streaming communications protocol. Videos encoded to HLS are created for different bandwidths and different resolutions. This provides a flexible means of delivering video on demand to content to a broad range of devices.\n\n\nThe Digital Domain HTML5 Player supports HTTP streaming, but HTTPS is preferred. HTTPS represents the newest standard because it is more secure. HTTPS is also required if you would like to include or request scripts, videos, images, iframes, etc.\n\n\nThe player supports the following HTTP Live Stream specification. The Live Media Playlist using HTTPS link outlines the preferred requirements.\n\n\n\n\nHTTP Live Streaming\n\n\nLive Media Playlist Using HTTPS\n\n\n\n\nRTSP\n\n\nReal Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP). A network control protocol used to control streaming media servers. The protocol is used for establishing and controlling media sessions between end points.\n\n\n\n\n\nBundle ID\n\n\nField used to specify the application Bundle ID (iOS) or Package Name (Android). This ID is a unique identifier for the application asset bundle that includes branding art and stylesheet information for the app (e.g. com.\n.\n). The Bundle ID is automatically created when an app is initially defined. The same Bundle ID must be used for when app updates are issued.  \n\n\nApplication ID (App ID)\n\n\nThe Application ID is automatically created by the Digital Domain Content Console at the time you define an application instance using \n+ Application\n. This id is used by the mobile device application to fetch the app's metadata (i.e., app assets uploaded to the Content Console).\n\n\nFor example, your mobile device app is live (i.e., published) and there is a requirement to update one of the application images. You upload the new asset to the app instance in the Content Console, the App ID gets passed to the mobile device API, and an API call is initiated that fetches the newly uploaded asset and updates the live application.   \n\n\nApplication URI Scheme\n\n\nRepresents the URI scheme used to open a mobile device application. To ensure a positive user experience, it's important to research your potential URI schemes to ensure that they are unique. You always want users of your app to be redirected to \nyour\n application when they are deep linking, and not conflict with similar applications using a similar URI scheme. Digital Domain native apps will always have the same URI Scheme (im360://). Custom apps can assign unique URI Schemes.\n\n\nStore URL\n\n\nEach application instance added to the Content Console requires that you specify a URL that represents the digital distribution platform (i.e., App Store) that will be used for your mobile app. The URL must launch the exact location of the platform-specific App Store where your app is published and can be downloaded. You receive your final App \nStore URL\n after your app completes the App Store review process. Some examples of App Store URLs for Digital Domain supported app platforms include:\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Play -  https://play.google.com/apps/\n\n\niOS -  https://itunes.apple.com/us/\n)\n\n\nGear VR - https://www.oculus.com/experiences/gear-vr/\n\n\nOculus Rift - https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/",

Copyright \u00a9 2015 Digital Domain Holding Ltd. All Rights Reserved. Do\nnot duplicate or redistribute in any form.\n\n\nContent Policy Guidelines\n\n\nItems posted or through this website service must follow the content policy and guidelines of Digital Domain Holdings Limited (\u201cDigital Domain\u201d) as detailed below. Producers or sellers of items through this website are expected to conduct proper research to ensure that these items are in compliance with all local, state, national, and international laws. If Digital Domain determines that the content of an item is prohibited for any reason, it may summarily remove or alter it without notice and without returning any fees that has been charged. Digital Domain reserves the right to make judgments about whether or not content is appropriate.\n\n\nPlease take a moment to familiarize yourself with some examples of prohibited content:\n\n\nPornography\n\n\nPornography, X-rated movies, home porn, hard-core material that depict graphic sexual acts, and amateur porn are not permitted. Unrated erotic videos and DVDs of the type you'd find at a typical bookstore are permitted for DVD distribution, but are not permitted Digital Domain distribution. Any permitted nudity, graphic titles, and descriptions must be sufficiently concealed with censor strips on all items containing such content.\n\n\nOffensive Material\n\n\nWhat we deem offensive is probably about what you would expect. This includes items such as crime-scene videos, videos of cruelty to animals, and extremely disturbing materials. Digital Domain reserves the right to determine the appropriateness of items sold on our site. Also, be aware of cultural differences and sensitivities. Some materials may be acceptable in one country, but unacceptable in another. Please keep in mind our global community of customers.\n\n\nIllegal Items\n\n\nItems sold through the Digital Domain service must adhere to all applicable laws. This includes the sale of items by individuals outside the United States. Some items that may not be sold include any products which may lead to the production of an illegal item or illegal activity.\n\n\nStolen Goods\n\n\nIf Digital Domain learns that an item is not the property of the seller, or was obtained through illegal means, we will immediately remove the item from our service without notice.\n\n\nItems that Infringe Upon an Individual's Privacy\n\n\nDigital Domain holds personal privacy in the highest regard. Therefore, items that infringe upon, or have potential to infringe upon, an individual's privacy are prohibited. Additionally, the sale of marketing lists (bulk e-mail lists, direct-mail marketing lists, etc.) is prohibited.\n\n\nRecopied Media\n\n\nCopies, dubs, duplicates, or transfers of music, videos, software, images, etc., are prohibited. Just as you cannot sell a photocopied book without the author's permission, you cannot sell copies or duplicates of videos, music, video games, software, photos, etc. Likewise, you cannot sell transferred media \u2013 whether laserdisc to video, CD-ROM to cassette tape, or from the Internet to any digital format--unless explicitly approved by the author.\n\n\nMovies\n\n\nUnauthorized copies of movies (VHS, DVD, etc.) may not be sold through Digital Domain. Also, movies that have been transferred from one format to another (unless done by the proper rights holder) are not permitted. For example, NTSC to Pal and Pal to NTSC conversions are not permitted unless done by the proper rights holder. Unreleased/pre-released movies, screeners and trailers are prohibited.\n\n\nTelevision Programs\n\n\nUnauthorized copies of television programs, including pay-per-view events, are prohibited. Commercially produced and licensed copies of television programs are permitted. Unauthorized television programs and unauthorized copies of programs never broadcast, unauthorized scripts, unauthorized props, and screeners are prohibited.\n\n\nMusic\n\n\nRecopied music in any format is prohibited. Bootlegs, unauthorized live concerts, unauthorized soundboard recordings, unauthorized merchandise, etc., is not permitted. Content containing unlicensed popular music as its soundtrack is not permitted. Likewise, \"mix\" CDs of unlicensed music are not permitted.\n\n\nPromotional Media\n\n\nMovies, CDs, software, etc., that are produced and distributed for promotional use only are prohibited for sale through Digital Domain.\n\n\nRights of Publicity\n\n\nCelebrity images and/or celebrity names cannot be used for commercial purposes without permission of the celebrity or their management. This includes product endorsements and merchandise as well as unauthorized celebrity image collections.\n\n\nPublic Domain and Other Non-Exclusive Content\n\n\nSome types of content, such as public domain content, may be free to use by anyone, or may be licensed for use by more than one party. We will not accept content that is freely available on the web unless you are the copyright owner of that content. For example, if you received your content from a source that allows you and others to re-distribute it, and the content is freely available on the web, we will not accept it for sale through Digital Domain. We do accept public domain content, however we may request that you provide proof that your submitted material is actually in the public domain and may choose to not sell a public domain title if its content is undifferentiated or barely differentiated from one or more books already available through our service or available through other retail sites.",

            "text": "Items posted or through this website service must follow the content policy and guidelines of Digital Domain Holdings Limited (\u201cDigital Domain\u201d) as detailed below. Producers or sellers of items through this website are expected to conduct proper research to ensure that these items are in compliance with all local, state, national, and international laws. If Digital Domain determines that the content of an item is prohibited for any reason, it may summarily remove or alter it without notice and without returning any fees that has been charged. Digital Domain reserves the right to make judgments about whether or not content is appropriate.  Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some examples of prohibited content:  Pornography  Pornography, X-rated movies, home porn, hard-core material that depict graphic sexual acts, and amateur porn are not permitted. Unrated erotic videos and DVDs of the type you'd find at a typical bookstore are permitted for DVD distribution, but are not permitted Digital Domain distribution. Any permitted nudity, graphic titles, and descriptions must be sufficiently concealed with censor strips on all items containing such content.  Offensive Material  What we deem offensive is probably about what you would expect. This includes items such as crime-scene videos, videos of cruelty to animals, and extremely disturbing materials. Digital Domain reserves the right to determine the appropriateness of items sold on our site. Also, be aware of cultural differences and sensitivities. Some materials may be acceptable in one country, but unacceptable in another. Please keep in mind our global community of customers.  Illegal Items  Items sold through the Digital Domain service must adhere to all applicable laws. This includes the sale of items by individuals outside the United States. Some items that may not be sold include any products which may lead to the production of an illegal item or illegal activity.  Stolen Goods  If Digital Domain learns that an item is not the property of the seller, or was obtained through illegal means, we will immediately remove the item from our service without notice.  Items that Infringe Upon an Individual's Privacy  Digital Domain holds personal privacy in the highest regard. Therefore, items that infringe upon, or have potential to infringe upon, an individual's privacy are prohibited. Additionally, the sale of marketing lists (bulk e-mail lists, direct-mail marketing lists, etc.) is prohibited.  Recopied Media  Copies, dubs, duplicates, or transfers of music, videos, software, images, etc., are prohibited. Just as you cannot sell a photocopied book without the author's permission, you cannot sell copies or duplicates of videos, music, video games, software, photos, etc. Likewise, you cannot sell transferred media \u2013 whether laserdisc to video, CD-ROM to cassette tape, or from the Internet to any digital format--unless explicitly approved by the author.  Movies  Unauthorized copies of movies (VHS, DVD, etc.) may not be sold through Digital Domain. Also, movies that have been transferred from one format to another (unless done by the proper rights holder) are not permitted. For example, NTSC to Pal and Pal to NTSC conversions are not permitted unless done by the proper rights holder. Unreleased/pre-released movies, screeners and trailers are prohibited.  Television Programs  Unauthorized copies of television programs, including pay-per-view events, are prohibited. Commercially produced and licensed copies of television programs are permitted. Unauthorized television programs and unauthorized copies of programs never broadcast, unauthorized scripts, unauthorized props, and screeners are prohibited.  Music  Recopied music in any format is prohibited. Bootlegs, unauthorized live concerts, unauthorized soundboard recordings, unauthorized merchandise, etc., is not permitted. Content containing unlicensed popular music as its soundtrack is not permitted. Likewise, \"mix\" CDs of unlicensed music are not permitted.  Promotional Media  Movies, CDs, software, etc., that are produced and distributed for promotional use only are prohibited for sale through Digital Domain.  Rights of Publicity  Celebrity images and/or celebrity names cannot be used for commercial purposes without permission of the celebrity or their management. This includes product endorsements and merchandise as well as unauthorized celebrity image collections.  Public Domain and Other Non-Exclusive Content  Some types of content, such as public domain content, may be free to use by anyone, or may be licensed for use by more than one party. We will not accept content that is freely available on the web unless you are the copyright owner of that content. For example, if you received your content from a source that allows you and others to re-distribute it, and the content is freely available on the web, we will not accept it for sale through Digital Domain. We do accept public domain content, however we may request that you provide proof that your submitted material is actually in the public domain and may choose to not sell a public domain title if its content is undifferentiated or barely differentiated from one or more books already available through our service or available through other retail sites.",
