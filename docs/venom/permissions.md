This topic provides information about Content Console staff permissions and supported roles.

## What is a staff permission?

A staff permission allows a Content Console account owner a level of access to console functionality based on an assigned role.

* All permissions are assigned at the Property level.
* Administrators send email invitations to potential staff members using the **+Invite** function.
* Invitations specify what role a member will serve and includes a summary of what tasks the member will have permission to perform in the role.  
* Administrators can assign Content Managers rights to invite members (i.e., Content Managers, Viewer).

## How do I access the staff permissions page?

You can access the *Staff Permissions* page by selecting a property on the Organization Home page, then the **Edit** menu bar on a specific Properties page.  

**Organization Home > Select Property Name > Edit**

## How do I invite staff to the content console?

## Where can I view a list of staff members that are part of my organization?

The **Users** section of the Content Console includes list of organization staff members. Each listing includes name, screen name, and join date.

## Can I send a staff invitation to someone who is not a member of the Content Console?

Yes, the invitee must first contact the site administrator and request an account. Once the account is approved and the invitee is a member, they can accept the staff invitation. The invitation email provides instructions if you are not currently a member.

## How do I contact my account administrator?

The **Organization Home > Dashboard** menu includes a "Contact your company's administrator" section that provides instructions on how to contact your site administrator.
