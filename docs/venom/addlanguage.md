# Introduction

The Add Language (**+ Language**) function allows you to add one or more instances of language metadata into a single video or live event profile.

* You select a Language Culture Name (e.g., en-US) and add your localized description metadata.

* Your mobile device application will then be configured to call a designated language instance and will present the localized copy on the app for the specific media item.  

* For example, if primary language of your mobile device application is Chinese, you would select + Language, select the zh-CN Language Culture Name, and enter the localized content.

* This approach allows you to define a single video or live event, and localize the display content in your custom app.
