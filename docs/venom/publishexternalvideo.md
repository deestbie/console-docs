## Step 3: Configure Video Security

Throughout the publishing cycle, your videos will require different levels of security for access, downloading, and sharing to social networks.

*As a best practice, set your video to Private for the initial upload. You will need to add key art and set the video start time in post upload activities.*

Video access levels include:

| Visibility Setting     | Description   |
|:----------------|:--------------------------------------|
| Private    | Video can be accessed by the console user who uploaded it.   |
| Internal    | Video can be accessed by the console administrator and designated console users.    |
| Public      | Video is visible to external consumers and can be accessed by console administrator and designated console users.    |

**To configure video security:**

1. Go to **Visibility**.
2. Select a option box to set the access level.

## Step 4: Enable / Disable Video Downloading

You can set whether you want to enable or disable the ability for an external consumer to download a video.

## Step 6: Define Video Metadata

Metadata is used to uniquely identify the characteristics of each video.

* The default language for metadata is *English*.
* A Consumer will see the metadata on websites where a video is posted.  
* A Publisher can search for metadata in the Content Console.
* You can add additional language versions on the **Edit Video** page after the video upload process is complete.
* See [Video Metadata](terms.md#video-metadata) more information on metadata types.
<!--* The Add Language function allows you to add a new metadata instance to a video profile.-->
<!--* Content for additional languages can be defined in a Excel template and uploaded to the Content Console.-->

**To define video metadata:**

## Step 9: Set Video Blind Spot

If your video includes a blind spot and you adjusted it in post-production by adding a custom photo, logo, or icon to fill the blank space, you can designate the blind spot location (None, Top or Bottom). See [Blind Spot](terms.md#blind-spot) for more information.

**To configure blind spot and projection:**

1. Go to **Blindspot**.
2. Select from the drop-down based on the following scenarios:

| If Projection =             |
|:-----------------|:-------------------------------------|
