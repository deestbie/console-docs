# Terminology

#### Property
Represents the top-level branding element of your videos (e.g., TV Network).

* Organization Administrators are responsible for creating and managing properties.
* A list of available properties display on the Content Console Home page.
* Within each property you define one or more mobile device applications.
* Within each property you define one or more video collections.
* You then add videos to collections defined in a property.
* You select a property and collection during the video upload process (i.e., Hosted, Live Event, URL).
* A video can be reassigned to a different property and collection after it is uploaded.
* A new property is auto-assigned a Display Priority number that reflects the display sequence on the Properties Summary. This setting can be updated as a post creation task using the Edit Property function. Numbers are assigned in sequential order based on when a property is initially defined.

#### Collection
A sub-category of a Property (e.g., TV Series Name). Within each Collection you also define a Season that represents a subcategory of the collection (i.e. episode #, etc.).  

#### Collection Type  
A subcategory of a Collection and is used for grouping video content.

* It can include one or more segments (i.e., video upload), a set of related productions, or a single event.
* Developing a good naming convention strategy for a Season is important to ensure a consistent presentation when adding additional seasons.
* For example, using Episode, Event, or Part consistently followed for a numbering sequence.

#### <a id="blind-spot"></a>Blind Spot

Because a 360 video is created using multiple cameras, it’s possible your video output could include some clipping of content referred to as a *Nadir Blind Spot*.

* The blind spot represents the position where the camera rig is supported and the tripod point is either left out of the video or the images are pinched together to eliminate the hole.

* The blind spot is usually corrected in post-production and filled in to imply a fully captured 360 image.

* The blind spot is typically filled by superimposing footage in that area or by inserting a “black” image at the nadir of the 360 video. The blind spot can then be used to populate with advertising space, navigations, or other uses.  

If your video includes a blind spot and you adjusted it in post-production by adding a custom photo, logo, or icon to fill the blank space, you can designate the blind spot location (None, Top or Bottom) on the video profile page.

#### Video Projection

Represents the video projection mapping mode. The Content Console supports [Flat](terms.md#flat-video-projection) and [Spherical](terms.md#spherical-video-projection) modes.  

#### <a id="flat-video-projection"></a>Flat Video Projection

This mode supports Monoscopic 360° videos. This video type is typically filmed with a single camera and stitched together to form a single equirectangular video.

#### <a id="spherical-video-projection"></a>Spherical Video Projection

This video type is usually filmed using two or more cameras and supports the use of HMD devices. Characteristics include:

* Uses stereoscopic technique to render images so there is a slight offset between your left and right eye.
* This view creates and impression of depth a full 360 experience.

#### Key Art

A still image file that is used to showcase your video.

* It typically uses a memorable image or icon that represents the essence of the story or topic presented in a video.
* You upload key art during the video publishing phase.
* Key Art displays on your video profile, property, and collection pages.
* Also referred to as a *Thumbnail*.

#### Video on Demand (VoD)

VoD stands for *Video on Demand*. This video format is saved in a MP4 file (required by the Content Console) and can be accessed any time by the user. VoD files can be directly uploaded to the Content Console, or can by specifying an external URL that represents where the video is stored (e.g., media server, content delivery network, etc.).

* This video format stores data (in a compressed form) that is required to depict a video signal. VoD files supported by the Content Console must be generated from 360 degree cameras.
* VoD files cannot be read in their initial "Raw" format and must be converted to the supported codec for video and audio file formats for mobile devices.
* When convert your VoD files to the required format, you will configure measurements for various categories of the video signal based on the file size you are converting the VoD file to.

See [Media Publishing Requirements](mediapublishrequirements.md) for more information on VoD conversion requirements for videos you would like to upload to the Content Console.
