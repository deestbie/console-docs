This topic provides information on the Content Console's video usage analytics capabilities.

## Data Collection for Video Usage

## Data Collection Process

* Data to be captured is defined in a business definition.
* Based on this definition raw data for Video on Demand (VoD) and live stream activity is collected.
* The data is then stored and segmented on a *per day* basis.
* The captured data is then transformed into metrics, analyzed, and summarized and grouped (e.g., daily, all).
* Data presentation is segregated based on collection point (i.e., external or internal).
* Collected data is then presented in a series of data tables on the Dashboard, Property, and Collection pages.
