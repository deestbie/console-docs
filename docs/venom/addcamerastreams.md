# Adding Multiple Live Stream Cameras

Cameras that support live 360 video stitching and streaming can utilize the live event option.

* You can live stream from a single 360 video camera or using an array of synchronized cameras (i.e., multiple 360 video cameras).

* You can add live stream URLs from your Media Server or Content Delivery Network, or you can live stream directly from your 360 camera (depending on internet connectivity).

* Using your 360 video camera, you can create a customized RTSP request URL stream link for external media players, or let your camera generate a default URL.

* Add a URL to the Content Console for each 360 video camera and specify a camera label that uniquely identifies the stream, angle, and unique characteristics.
