# Introduction

If you will be broadcasting your live event using multiple 360 cameras, you can set up additional camera streams using our *+ New Camera* option.

* The main stream event you specified on the *New Event* upload page will typically represent your live event master shot.
* Additional cameras generally cover various angles of close-ups of your live event subject matter.
* You can also set up additional cameras to pan and zoom live event action.
* During the live event, you then use your switcher to go back to the main stream event when an event pauses, if you need to make adjustments (i.e., audio, camera focus, shot width adjustment, etc.)
