# Video Publishing Requirements

## What activities are involved in managing video content on the Digital Domain Content Console?

* Content to be presented on Digital Domain websites or mobile device applications must be added to our Content Console.
* If you are not using a Media Server or Content Delivery Network, video content can be directly uploaded to our Content Console.
* Video content must be converted to the required format for Video on Demand (VOD) and Live Streaming video types prior to upload.
* Live stream URLs can be added from your Media Server or Content Delivery Network, or you can live stream directly from your 360 camera (depending on internet connectivity).
* Key Art (i.e., thumbnail) files for video uploads must be uploaded directly to the Content Console and cannot be referenced using a URL.

## What prerequisite steps must be completed prior to publishing content?

Before you publish video and application digital assets to the Content Console you must complete the following steps:

### Step 1. Create Digital Assets

Prepare the following digital assets and have them available prior to creating a video profile in the Content Console. Because you will be required to upload a video, video URL, or post a live stream URL before you can save your video profile, having these assets available will help to expedite the video publishing process. 

| Options          | Video Sort View                   |
|:-------------------|:-------------------------------------|
| 360 Video Files       | Shoot 360 videos, perform post production, and generate output files.             |
| Video Metadata         | Define video Title, Headline, Description, and Search Tags for each video language version. |
| Key Art          | Define thumbnails for each video that will stored in the Content Management System (i.e. Content Console).|


### Step 2. Determine Digital Asset Storage and Management Approach
