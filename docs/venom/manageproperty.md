The first step in the video/app publishing process is to define a property. A property has the following characteristics:

* A property represents the top-level branding element of your video collections and mobile device applications.
* A list of available properties display on the Content Console Home page.
* Within each property you define one or more mobile device applications.
* Within each property you define one or more video collections.
* You then add videos to collections defined in a property.
* You select a property and collection during the video upload process (i.e., Hosted, Live Event, URL).
* A video can be reassigned to a different property and collection after it is uploaded.
* A new property is auto-assigned a Display Priority number that reflects the display sequence on the *Properties Summary*. This setting can be updated as a post creation task using the Edit Property function. Numbers are assigned in sequential order based on when a property is initially defined.
