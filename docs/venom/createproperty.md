# Define Video Property

The first step in the video publishing process is to define a property. A property has the following characteristics:

* A Property represents the top-level branding element of your video Collections.
* A list of available Properties display on the Content Console Home page.
* Within each Property you define one or more Collection.
* You then add videos to Collections defined in a Property.
* A video can be reassigned to a different Property and Collection after it is uploaded.

**To define a property:**

1. On the **Home** page go to **Properties**.
2. Select **+Property**. The *Create a New Property* pop-up displays.
