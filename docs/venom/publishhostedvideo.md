# Publishing a Hosted Video

The Content Console offers a flexible video publishing platform where you can tailor your configuration workflow based on your requirements and availability of your video digital assets.

The following tutorial illustrates how to publish a video that is hosted on the Content Console.

# **Part 1: Configure Video Property and Collection**

## Step 1: Launch the Content Console

1. Launch the Content Console and log in using your credentials. The *Home* page displays.

## Step 2: Define Video Property

The first step in the video publishing process is to define a Property. A Property has the following characteristics:

* A Property represents the top-level branding element of your videos (e.g., TV Network).
* A video must be added directly to a Property.
* A list of available Properties display on the Content Console Home page.
* A video can be reassigned to a different Property after it is uploaded.

**To define a property:**

1. On the **Home** page go to **Properties**.
2. Select **+Property**. The *Create a New Property* pop-up displays.

3. Enter the Property name, headline, and description, then **Create**. The new property is added to the *Properties* page listing.

## Step 3: Define Video Collection

Within each Property you then define a Collection:

- A Collection is a sub-category of a Property (e.g., TV Series Name).
- After adding a new video asset, you then assign it to a Property and Collection.
- Videos in a Collection can be reordered.
- You can reassign a video to a different Property and Collection.
- Within each Collection you also define a Season that represents a subcategory of the collection (i.e. episode #, etc.)

To define a collection:

1. In **Home > Properties > Property Name**, select **+Collection**. The *Create New Collection* pop-up displays.
![Home](add_collection.jpg "Add Collection")
3. Enter the collection name, description, and type, then **OK**. The *Collection* page displays.

# Part 2: Define Basic Video information

This section allows you to set the property and collection the video is contained in, and define the video metadata (i.e., title, description, tags).

## Step 1: Select Video Upload Method

1. In **Home > Properties > Property Name > Collection**.
2. In the collection select Upload Video (**+Upload Video**).
3. On the Uploader screen, select **Hosted Video**.

## Step 2: Select a Property

Change the default property assigned to your video and group your video in a collection. Note that both steps are required.

1. In **Select a Property** section, the currently assigned property is selected. To reassign the current video to a new property, select it from the drop-down.
2. After you select the property, the **Select a Collection"** drop-down displays and presents a list of collections associated with the current property. Select a collection to assign to the video.

## Step 3: Define Video Metadata

Metadata is used to uniquely identify the characteristics of each video.

* Videos can be tagged with metadata including Title, Description, and Search Tags.
* The default language for metadata is *English*.
* A Consumer will see the metadata on websites where a video is posted.  
* A Publisher can search for metadata in the Content Console.
* The Add Language function allows you to add a new metadata instance to a video profile.
* Content for additional languages can be defined in a Excel template and uploaded to the Content Console.

**Title (Required)**

* Effective titles summarize the video subject.
* They typically contain 5 words are less.
* Use descriptive keywords that grab a viewers attention.
* Should make sense out of context when they appear in search research.

**Description**

* Effective descriptions are concise (e.g., a small paragraph or lead-in sentence with bullet points).
* Should include exciting descriptions about video topic that will attract viewers attention.
* Should include hashtags (#) so they can be easily promoted on social media site.
* Should include credits associated with video creator, participants, actors, promoters, etc.

**Search Tags**

* Search tags help to promote your video on social media sites and search engines.
* Should contain keywords on who you are (individual, business, event, etc.)
* To gain an edge on coverage, perform research on competitors, sites most relevant to your video subject, and tag names.
* Search tags must be comma separated.

**To define video metadata:**

1. Go to the **Primary Language** section.
2. Enter the Title and Description for your video.
3. Enter one or more Tags (comma separated).

## Step 4: Configure Video Security

Throughout the publishing cycle, your videos will require different levels of security for access, downloading, and sharing to social networks. Video access levels include:

* **Private** - Video can be accessed by the console user who uploaded it.
* **Internal** - Video can be accessed by the console administrator and designated console users.
* **Public** - Video is visible to external consumers and can be accessed by console administrator and designated console users.
* The default setting is *Private*.

**As a best practice, set your video to private for the initial upload. You will need to add key art and set the broadcast time in post upload activities.**

**To configure video security:**

1. Go to the **Who can see your video?** section.
2. Select a radio button to set the access level.

## Step 5: Enable / Disable Video Downloading

You can set whether you want to enable or disable the ability for external consumer to download video.

* Option uses download method supported by website or device.
* Consumer must comply with video download terms of service of website or device.
* The default setting is *No*.

**To enable / disable video downloading:**

1. Go to the **Can users download your video?** section.
2. Select a radio button to enable/disable video download (i.e., Yes/No).

## Step 6: Set Video Blind Spot

Because your 360 video is created using multiple cameras, it’s possible your video output could include some clipping of content referred to as a "Nadir Blind Spot."

* The blind spot represents the position where the camera rig is supported and the tripod point is either left out of the video or the images are pinched together to eliminate the hole.

* The blind spot is usually corrected in post-production and filled in to imply a fully captured 360 image.

* The blind spot is typically filled by superimposing footage in that area or by inserting a “black” image at the nadir of the 360 video. The blind spot can then be used to populate with advertising space, navigations, or other uses.  

If your video includes a blind spot and you have not adjusted it in post-production, you can designate the blind spot location (Top or Bottom) and add a custom photo, logo, or icon to fill the blank space.

**To configure blind spot and projection:**

1. Go to **Video Blindspot?** and configure as follows:
2. If Projection = Flat, Blind Spot = None
3. If Projection = Spherical and video includes a Blind Spot, Blind Spot = Top or Bottom
4. If Projection = Spherical and video does not include a Blind Spot, Blind Spot = None

## Step 7: Set Video Projection

Indicate what type of video you will be uploading.

* **Flat** - This mode supports Monoscopic 360° videos. This video type is typically filmed with a single camera and stitched together to form a single equirectangular video.
* **Spherical** - This video type is usually filmed using two or more cameras and supports the use of HMD devices. Characteristics include:
      * Uses stereoscopic technique to render images so there is a slight offset between your left and right eye.
      * This view creates and impression of depth a full 360 experience.

**To set video projection:**

1. Go to **Video Projection?**.
2. Select a radio button to set video projection (i.e., Spherical or Flat).

## Step 8: Select Video Category

You can assign a category to video to make it easier for consumers to find (e.g., Entertainment, Sports, Music, Action, Family, etc.).

**To set video category:**

1. Go to **Video Category Type**.
2. From the drop-down select a category.
