# Introduction

This topic provides an overview of how the application publishing process works, and continues with information on supported platforms, general requirements list, digital asset requirements, and localization requirements.

## How does the application publishing process work?

The production and publishing of a Digital Domain mobile device application involves the following key activities:

| Activity        | Description |
|:----------------|:--------------------------------------|
| Application Design and Development     | Digital Domain *Client Services*: <p></p><ul><li>Manages the application design and development cycle.</li> <li>Works with each client to gather specific requirements.</li> <li>Works with the development staff through the app development cycle.</li> <li>Refines the application design through a review and quality assurance testing cycle.</li></ul>  |
| Publish Application to App Stores     | When an application is ready to be published: <p></p><ul><li> Digital Domain *Client Services* submits each mobile device application to the platform-specific app store.</li> <li>After the app store review / publishing cycle is complete, the app is published to the app store. </li><li>A published app will be available for download via the designated Store URL based on each clients' selected launch date.</li>|

## What application platforms are supported?

| App Platform         | Description               |
|:-----------------|:-------------------------------------|
| iOS       | Native mobile app written in Objective C for iOS operating system.   |
| Android         | Native app written in Java for Android operating system. |
| GearVR Gear VR Mobile Headset        | Custom Android app written using Unity3D software.  |
| Oculus Rift Virtual Reality Headset      | Custom app written using Unity3D software and the Oculus Rift SDK.    |

## What requirements are gathered for each mobile device application?

* Determine if a native or custom application is needed and define requirements.
* Determine what platforms app will be supported on (iOS, Android, GearVR, Oculus Rift).
* Determine app stores apps will be published on.
* Determine localization requirements for each app.
* Determine assets required for each app.

## What digital assets are required for each mobile device application?

A series of digital assets will need to be developed for each application.

* The assets will be unique for each application based the requirements defined with your *Client Services* representative.
* Developed assets will be uploaded an application instanced defined in the Digital Domain Content Console. Examples of asset types include:

| Asset         | Description                |
|:-----------------|:-------------------------------------|
| App Branding Logos  | Custom branding logos for app pages (.PNG).  |
| CMS Branding Logos  | Custom branding logos for Content Console Organization page (.PNG)   |
| Landing/Splash Page  | App landing page images. (.JPG)               |
| Event Icons      | Unique icons for specific app events or sections.                 |
| App Icons  | App icon that will display on each mobile device after application is installed (.PNG file type)  |
| Video Player Icons  | Icon that will display on app video player to uniquely identify your brand. (.PNG file type)  |
| Brand Assets       | Set of full sized brand assets for design development.     |
| Background Images   | Keyframe images to be used for live events or VoD metadata. This requirement will vary per each custom app.                |

Each onboarding specification document will include:

* Size requirements and format requirements of digital assets for each platform-specific app.
* Image name requirements to be assigned to each digital asset. Adhering to the defined naming convention is important, because if an asset requires updating in the Content Console, it will be immediately available in the published app.

## How do I publish an application instance on the Content Console?

See [Publish Application](publishapp.md) for detailed instructions on how to add an application instance to the Content Console.

## How do I publish application assets on the Content Console?
