These sizes apply to iOS and Android apps. There will be a separate guide for GearVR.

Image sizes have layout buffers built into them, so your supplied images can go right to the edge of the canvas. For the non-square images, the width is the maximum that the image can take up. You can choose to make them less. The image will be centered horizontally.

All images should be 32-bit non-interlaced PNGs unless otherwise specified.
