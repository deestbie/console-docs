# Introduction

This topic provides information on the Content Console's data monitoring capabilities.

### Data Collection Areas

The Content Console compiles monitoring data related to live and on demand video streams. Data is collected for external video usage and internally for console artifacts.

### Video Usage (External)

Usage monitoring is performed on external Video on Demand (VoD) and Live Streams. Statistical data can help you determine audience size, number of unique visitors, peak traffic time, etc. and can be used to optimize your video outreach strategy.

### Content Console Artifacts (Internal)

Usage monitoring is performed for Content Console Artifacts and tracks the actual number of artifacts that are added to the Content Console. This data can be useful to gauge overall number of assets, balance of content in a particular Property or Collection, number of Published versus Private videos, etc.

| Report Name | Description   |
|:----------------|:--------------------------------------|
| Collection Interval  | Immediately throughout the content management cycle. |
| Visibility  | Organization Administrators and Publishers |
| Performance Tracking  | Views, Videos, Streams, Apps, Members, Properties, Collections |

### Data Collection Process

* Data to be captured is defined in a business definition.
* Based on this definition raw data for Video on Demand (VoD) and live stream activity is collected.
* The data is then stored and segmented on a *per day* basis.
* The captured data is then transformed into metrics, analyzed, and summarized and grouped (e.g., daily, all).
* Data presentation is segregated based on collection point (i.e., external or internal).
* Collected data is then presented in a series of data tables on the Dashboard, Property, and Collection pages.
