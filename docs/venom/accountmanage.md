#	Introduction

This topic provides information about account management.

### Who do I contact if I have questions about my account?

When our Client Services department created your account, you received a Welcome Kit email that included your username/password, login URL, and introductory information.

If you have additional questions, contact your Client Services representative.

### How do I reset my password?

To reset your password:

1. Select **Home > Users > Forgot Password**.
2. Enter your email address, then **OK**.
3. Follow the instructions in reset email.

### How do I change my email address?

Once an account is created, the email address associated with the account cannot be changed. Contact Customer Support if you need to create a new account with a new email address.
